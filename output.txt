The Credit Score Analysis, powered by CreditXpert, simulates changes to the credit file to calculate the potential score impact of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
filing. It simulates filing the Chapter 7 bankruptcy immediately, followed 3 months later by discharge of all debt other than student loans and mortgages. It also 
simulates opening a revolving credit card with a $500 credit limit 2 months after discharge, and then maintaining a balance of $300 on that card for 10 months. 
The final score is calculated 15 months from now (one year after the bankruptcy discharge). myHorizon assumes that monthly payments will be made on time 
for mortgages and student loans, and that zero-balance credit accounts will be closed by creditors at the time of discharge. Accounts last reported 4 or more
 
months ago are not included in the bankruptcy filing unless they are derogatory accounts.  CreditXpert@ products are based on information derived from credit 
reports produced by the major credit reporting agencies. CreditXpert Inc. is not responsible for inaccurate results, including any due to incorrect, missing, 
outdated credit report information or incorrect assumptions about the future. Scores and score changes predicted by CreditXpert products are only estimates

DISCLOSURES FROM CIN AND EXPERIAN:  The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows you to obtain a disclosure from every credit reporting agency of the 
nature and substance of all information in your file at the time of the request. Full disclosure of information in your file at Experian must be obtained directly from 
Experian by calling 888-397-3742 or logging on to www.experian.com/consumer .  This credit report you are receiving  from CIN is not intended to constitute 
the disclosure of Experian information required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act or similar state laws. You are entitled to receive a disclosure directly from the 
consumer reporting agency free of charge under the following circumstances: a. You have been denied credit, insurance or employment within the past sixty 
(60) days as a result of your credit report; b. You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning
on the date on which you made the certification; c. You are a recipient of public welfare assistance; d. You have reason to believe that your file at the agency
contains inaccurate information due to fraud; and e. annually at www.annualcreditreport.com .  Otherwise, the consumer reporting agency may impose a
reasonable charge for the disclosure.  The Fair Credit Reporting Act permits you to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your credit file.  You
understand that accurate information cannot be changed.  You do not have to purchase your credit report or other information from CIN to dispute inaccurate or
incomplete information in your Experian file or to receive a copy of my Experian consumer credit report.  Experian ’s National Consumer Assistance Center
provides a proprietary consumer disclosure that is different from the consumer credit report provided by CIN.  The disclosure report must be obtained directly
from Experian.  Consumers residing in the States of Colorado, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, and Vermont may receive a free copy of their consumer
credit report once per year and residents of the State of Georgia may receive two copies per year.   Fraud Alerts are available to any eligible consumers —free of
charge —from a national consumer reporting agency.

STATE LAW NOTICES.  You may be entitled to additional fair credit reporting rights under State Law.  You may visit www.cingroup.com/legal/fcra  for a 
listing of States ’ Notices of Consumers ’ Rights.

A Summary of Your Rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act
The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are 
many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing 
histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. For more information, including information about 
additional rights, go to www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore  or write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.
●You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your
application for credit, insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse action against you - must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone
number of the agency that provided the information.
●You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your “file
disclosure”). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You
are entitled to a free file disclosure if:   ●a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report;  ● you are the victim of
identity theft and place a fraud alert in your file; ●your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud; ●you are on public assistance; and/or ●you are
unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.
●In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty
consumer reporting agencies. See www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore  for additional information.
●You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You
may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to
pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender. 
●You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the
consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore  for an explanation of
dispute procedures.
●Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must
be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.
●Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information
that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old. 
●Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need -- usually to consider an
application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.
●You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or
a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information,
go to www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore .
●You may limit "prescreened" offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited "prescreened" offers for credit and
insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may
opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-567-8688.
●You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a
consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.
●Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore .
●States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In some cases, you may have more rights under state law. For more
information, contact your state or local consumer protection agency or your state Attorney General.

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided credit report, here are the key factors that will be crucial in deciding whether to approve or deny a loan application:

1. Credit Scores:
- Sam Sample: Current score 560, potential post-bankruptcy score 630 (+60)
- Pat Sample: Current score 680, potential post-bankruptcy score 725 (+45)
The current scores, especially Sam's, are low and indicate high credit risk. However, the potential for improvement post-bankruptcy is significant.

2. Summary of Accounts with Balances:
- Total accounts: 37
- Total monthly payments: $5,002
- Total balances remaining: $83,864
- Past due accounts: 14 (37.84% of total accounts)
- Total amounts past due: $21,180
These figures show a high debt load and a significant portion of accounts being past due, indicating financial distress.

3. Account Types and Status:
- Collection accounts: 3 (100% past due, total $6,899)
- Installment accounts: 10 (20% past due, total balance $17,673)
- Revolving accounts: 24 (37.50% past due, total balance $59,292)
The high number of past due accounts, especially in revolving credit, is concerning.

4. Payment History:
Multiple accounts show a history of late payments, with some accounts having severe delinquencies (90+ days late).

5. High Credit Utilization:
Several credit card accounts are near or at their limits, indicating high credit utilization.

6. Recent Account Closures:
Multiple accounts have been closed recently, some by the creditor, which may indicate financial difficulties or creditor concerns.

7. Employment Stability:
Multiple employment variations listed, which could indicate frequent job changes or unstable income.

8. Potential Bankruptcy:
The credit score analysis includes potential post-bankruptcy scores, suggesting bankruptcy might be under consideration.

9. Absence of Public Records:
No bankruptcies, liens, or judgments are reported, which is a positive factor.

10. Length of Credit History:
Some accounts date back to 2012-2014, indicating a relatively established credit history.

These factors paint a picture of significant financial distress, with high debt loads, multiple past due accounts, and low credit scores. The potential for score improvement post-bankruptcy suggests that this might be under consideration. Any loan approval decision would need to carefully weigh these negative factors against any positive aspects of the applicant's financial situation not reflected in this credit report.[00m

Credit Decision Report

Applicants: Sam Sample and Pat Sample
Date: [Current Date]

Overall Creditworthiness Assessment:
Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided credit report, the applicants' current creditworthiness is assessed as poor, with significant financial distress evident.

Key Risk Factors:
1. Low Credit Scores: Sam (560) and Pat (680) have scores indicating high credit risk.
2. High Debt Load: 37 total accounts with $83,864 total balances and $5,002 monthly payments.
3. Delinquency: 37.84% of accounts (14 out of 37) are past due, totaling $21,180.
4. Collection Accounts: 3 accounts in collections, totaling $6,899.
5. Payment History: Multiple accounts show late payments, some with severe delinquencies.
6. High Credit Utilization: Several credit cards near or at limits.
7. Recent Account Closures: Multiple accounts closed recently, some by creditors.
8. Employment Stability: Multiple employment variations listed.

Positive Factors:
1. No public records (bankruptcies, liens, or judgments) reported.
2. Established credit history dating back to 2012-2014.
3. Potential for credit score improvement post-bankruptcy (Sam: +60, Pat: +45).

Recommendation:
Given the significant financial distress evident in the credit report, including low credit scores, high delinquency rates, and substantial debt load, we cannot recommend approval for a loan at this time. The risks associated with lending to these applicants are currently too high.

However, we note the potential for credit score improvement, possibly through bankruptcy. We recommend the applicants take steps to improve their financial situation, such as:
1. Addressing past due accounts and collections
2. Reducing overall debt load
3. Improving payment history on existing accounts
4. Seeking credit counseling or considering bankruptcy if appropriate

The applicants may reapply after demonstrating significant improvement in their credit profile and financial stability over time.[00m
